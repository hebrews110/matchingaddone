Add one matching game for kinder/first

Known Issues
   
Silk browser - Flashes every time you select something

    FIXED   
       Firefox - numbers highlight in blue
       The audio used to play fine and now it's saying file not found. (It's always looking in folder with index.)
       Keeps flashing when game restarts - just changed it to flash the colors one time instead of in cycle
       Hover over play doesn't work
      --took out, apparently transitions for display aren't really a thing, Transition timings aren't applying
